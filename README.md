# ARCHE Vault

This is the central repository for the development of the ARCHE symbolic intelligence framework, grounded in Whiteheadian process metaphysics and symbolic computation.

## üß† Vault Philosophy

- This vault grows iteratively through **drops** ‚Äî curated document sessions.
- Each drop is parsed into discrete Zettelkasten-style notes:
  - `Concepts/`, `Modules/`, `Contracts/`, `Formulas/`, `Zones/`
- Each note is cross-linked with:
  - A **Drop Summary** (`Drops/Drop_YYYYMMDD_Summary.md`)
  - The **Master Log** (`Indexes/20250610M - ARCHE Master Log Index.md`)
  - The **Tag Index** (`Indexes/20250611I - Tag Index.md`)

## üîÅ Drop Integration Workflow

1. **Extract** each new drop ZIP into this vault folder
2. **Overwrite** existing files if prompted
3. Open vault in Obsidian ‚Üí changes auto-load
4. Optionally:
   - Run `git status && git commit` if Git-enabled
   - Review Drop Summary note and backlinks

## üîñ Organised By

- `Modules/`: Core systems, engines, and architecture specs
- `Concepts/`: Symbolic ideas, metaphysical terms, reflexive constructs
- `Contracts/`: Logical constraints, rupture rules, symbolic laws
- `Formulas/`: Mathematical encodings of symbolic relations
- `Zones/`: Interpretive fields, semantic spaces, rupture layers
- `Drops/`: Session summaries and source provenance
- `Indexes/`: Master log, tag map, change timeline

## üß© Structure Is Emergent
The vault evolves. Themes cross-link. Narrative and coherence unfold recursively. Each drop grows the whole.
